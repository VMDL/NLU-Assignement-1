# NLU-Assignement-1

The source code is entirely written in Python and it has been enterly written and tested on Google Colaboratory.

## Requirements

In order to test the [assigment](https://github.com/VMDL/NLU-Assignement-1/blob/main/Assignment.ipynb) it is required a Jupyter Notebook.

The libraries that have been used are spaCy and NLTK as required by the assignment.

The only additional package to be installed is: pytextdist in order to compute the Levenshtein distance which is required to compute the distances in the optional part of the assignment, moreover the command:"!pip install pytextdist" has been already included in the source code.

## Test setting

Every function has a test associated, moreover they have already been initialized the variable required to test the function in order to simplify the testing.

## Go into detail

Further explanation about the logic behind the source code can be find in [Report.pdf](https://github.com/VMDL/NLU-Assignement-1/blob/main/Report.pdf)
